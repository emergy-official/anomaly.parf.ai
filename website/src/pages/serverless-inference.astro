        This model was trained remotely on a g4dn.xlarge instance. It slightly differs from EfficientAD by using
        5k steps instead of 70k while still achieving similar result. The model deployed here is using the cookie
        dataset three.

        provisioned concurrency endpoint, putting the price at ~13$/month to keep it running + 0.18$ per 1k inference.
        Or even instant by using real-time inference (starting at 42$/month).

        Using serverless allows to have hundreds of endpoints to show differents ideas without impacting your wallet,
        once you're ready to scale up, simply switch!

            The endpoint configuration is set to allow two concurrent executions. If you try to upload images too
            quickly, it will result in a 502 error.

            The model has not been fully optimized to work with any image size, though it can be configured to do so. In
            this POC, use square images and ensure they are under 5MB.
